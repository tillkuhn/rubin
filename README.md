## Introduction

*rubin* is a thin wrapper around the [Confluent  REST Proxy API (v3)](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka-rest/api.html#records-v3) that makes it easy to produce 
structured event records into an existing Kafka Topic. 

It's written in Go, can be used as a CLI standalone binary or as a library, and uses just plain http communication.

## Installation and usage

### Use as standalone CLI

Grap the most recent release from the [releases page](https://github.com/tillkuhn/rubin/releases) and make sure your environment is configured properly (see *help* section below for additional optional args)

```
$ printenv | grep -e ^KAFKA

KAFKA_REST_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:443
KAFKA_PRODUCER_API_KEY=1234567890
KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID=abc-r2d2
KAFKA_PRODUCER_API_SECRET=********
```

Run the standalone binary (simple example with string message)

```
$ rubin -topic public.hello -record "Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean"

9:49PM	INFO	rubin/main.go:60	Welcome to rubin  {"version": "v0.0.5", "built": "now", "commit": "7759eb6"}
9:49PM	INFO	rubin/client.go:27	Kafka REST Proxy Client configured  {"endpoint": "https://localhost:443", "useSecret": true}
9:49PM	INFO	rubin/client.go:53	Push record  {"url": "https://localhost.cloud:443/kafka/v3/clusters/abc-r2d2/topics/public.hello/records"}
9:49PM	INFO	rubin/client.go:84	Record committed  {"status": "topic", "public.hello": 200, "offset": 43, "partition": 0}
```

Example with JSON Payload, custom message key and multiple message headers

```
$ rubin -topic public.hello -record '{"msg":"hello"}' -key "123" -header "source=ci" -header "mood=good"
```

Get Help on CLI arguments and environment configuration

```
$ rubin -help

Welcome to rubin v0.1.5 built now by go (b368bf8)

This application is configured via the environment. The following environment
variables can be used:

KEY                          TYPE             DEFAULT    REQUIRED    DESCRIPTION
KAFKA_REST_ENDPOINT          String                      false       Kafka REST Proxy Endpoint
KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID             String                      false       Kafka Cluster ID
KAFKA_PRODUCER_API_KEY       String                      false       Kafka API Key with Producer Privileges
KAFKA_PRODUCER_API_SECRET    String                      false       Kafka API Secret with Producer Privileges
KAFKA_HTTP_TIMEOUT           Duration         10s        false       Timeout for HTTP Client
KAFKA_DUMP_MESSAGES          True or False    false      false       Print http request/response to stdout
KAFKA_LOG_LEVEL              String           info       false       Min LogLevel debug,info,warn,error

```
```
In addition, the following CLI arguments are supported
  -ce
    	CloudEvents format for event payload (default: STRING or JSON)
  -header value
    	Header formatted as key=value, can be used multiple times
  -help
    	Display this help
  -key string
    	Kafka Message Key (optional, default is generated uuid)
  -record string
    	Request payload to send into the Kafka Topic
  -source string
    	CloudEventy: The context in which an event happened (default "rubin/cli")
  -subject string
    	CloudEventy: The subject of the event in the context of the event producer
  -topic string
    	Name of target Kafka Topic
  -type string
    	CloudEvents: Type of event related to the originating occurrence (default "event.Event")
  -v string
    	Verbosity, one of 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error' (default "info")
```

### Use as library in an external Go app

```
go get github.com/tillkuhn/rubin
```
```
client := rubin.New(&rubin.Options{
	RestEndpoint:      "https://localhost:443",
	ClusterID:         "abc-r2d2",
	ProducerAPIKey:    "1234567890",
	ProducerAPISecret: "**********",
})
resp, err := cc.Produce(context.Background(), Record{
	Topic:   "public.hello",
	Data:    "Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean",
	Key:     "134-5678",
	Headers: map[string]string{"heading": "for tomorrow"},
})
fmt.Printf("Record successfully commited, offset=%d partition=%d\n", resp.Offset, resp.PartitionId)
```

### üê≥ Use as docker image

Released vaultpal versions are build for multiple architectures and pushed to the public GitHub Container Registry (https://ghcr.io).

```
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tillkuhn/rubin:v0.1.2 -help
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Support for *CloudEvents*

In Addition to simple string records and json payloads, *rubin* also supports [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), a "a specification for describing event data in common formats to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems", hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). See the `-ce` switch and the [JSON Spec for CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md) for more details.

CloudEvents with CLI
```
$ rubin -topic public.hello -record '{"action":"push"}' \
    -ce -type "events.published" -source "/ci/build/123" -subject "artifact.zip"
```
CloudEvents with library
```
payload := map[string]string{"user": "james.bond", "id": "007"}
event, err = NewCloudEvent("//hr/manager", "user.created", payload)
resp, err := cc.Produce(ctx, Request{ "app.user",  event})
```
Resulting event structure (CLI example code)
```
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "id": "5b4eefde-bf4a-4d48-8f47-e2978df8d139",
  "source": "/ci/build/123",
  "type": "events.published",
  "subject": "artifact.zip",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json",
  "time": "2023-11-04T14:11:33Z",
  "data": {
	"action": "push"
  }
 }
```

## Why the funky name?

Initially I thought of technical names like `kafka-record-prodcer` or `topic-pusher`, but all of them turned out to be pretty boring. [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin) was simply the first name that showed up when I googled for "famous record producers", so I named the tool in his honour, and also in honour of the great Albums he produced in the past decades.

## API stability

The package API for rubin is still version zero and therefore not yet considered stable as described in [gopkg.in](https://gopkg.in)

## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [go/template](https://github.com/SchwarzIT/go-template), an efficient tool to "provides a blueprint for production-ready Go project layouts."
